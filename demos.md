## MetaGenomics - PathoTRACK app

Hackathon Goals: 

- create a VM with the PathoTRACK platform using Slipstream and launch it on Exoscale Cloud and IFB Openstask cloud (pilot)
- try to create an application with Slipstream with multi components (each dedicated to a service of PathoTRACK platform)


Application and components are available in [UC12 folder in Slipstream workspace](https://nuv.la/module/cyclone/UC12_metagenomics_pathotrack).

2 components are working at the end of the hackathon: mysql server and PathoTRACK web user interface server.

Next steps will be the configuration of input and output variables for components and try to interconnect them in application configuration.
