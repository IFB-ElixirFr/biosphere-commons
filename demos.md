# UC2 Cloud virtual pipeline for microbial genomes analysis

## Insyght

## SGE and miniconda

## Scripts
Function (that will be) used in UC2 are regrouped in [./scripts/](https://github.com/cyclone-project/usecases-hackathon-2016/tree/master/scripts) with a HOWTO detailing their usage. [A component](https://nuv.la/module/cyclone/neo4j/script_tester#5-application-workflows+4-deployment) and [a recipe](https://nuv.la/module/cyclone/neo4j/allows_access_example/6553#1-application-components) have been made to allow you to see them in action.

# UC12 MetaGenomics - PathoTRACK app

Hackathon Goals: 

- create a VM with the PathoTRACK platform using Slipstream and launch it on Exoscale Cloud and IFB Openstask cloud (pilot)
- try to create an application with Slipstream with multi components (each dedicated to a service of PathoTRACK platform)


Application and components are available in [UC12 folder in Slipstream workspace](https://nuv.la/module/cyclone/UC12_metagenomics_pathotrack).

2 components are working at the end of the hackathon: mysql server and PathoTRACK web user interface server.

Next steps will be the configuration of input and output variables for components and try to interconnect them in application configuration.
